		            Calvinball Rules:

                1. A player's score is reduced by 50 is they have an exercise ball.
                2. a player's score is multiplied by 3 if they have had coffee, but reduced by 100 if they had tea.
                3. A player gets an extra play if they are left handed.
                4. A player's score is doubled if they are holding the lightsaber, and yelling "I am the apple", but halved if they aren't yelling.
                5. if player's battery is less than 50%, their score is reduced by the percentage of their battery. If above, they get percentage added to score.
