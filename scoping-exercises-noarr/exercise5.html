		Exercise 5

		Bean counting

		(From EJS, Ch. 3 Exercises, Pg 56.)

		You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string".charAt(N), similar to how you get its length with "s".length. The returned value will be a string containing only one character (for example, "b"). The first character has position zero, which causes the last one to be found at position string.length - 1. In other words, a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.

		Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters are in the string.

		Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.
		 */



		// Tests
		console.log(countBs("Blah Blah Blah") === 3);
		console.log(countBs("abcde") === 0);
		console.log(countBs("ABCDE") === 1);
		console.log(countBs("") === 0);

		console.log(countChar("kayak", "k") === 2);
		console.log(countChar("kayak", "K") === 0);
		console.log(countChar("eaee", "e") === 3);
		console.log(countChar("", "a") === 0);
